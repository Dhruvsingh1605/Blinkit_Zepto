Weather-Smart Shopping Assistant üå¶Ô∏èüõí  Inspired by the Vadodara floods, this application uses machine learning to analyze weather forecasts and predict heavy rainfall. It suggests essential products to users a day before expected rain, ensuring preparedness and seamless shopping even when delivery services may be disrupted. 

1. Data Requirements
Historical weather data (rainfall, temperature, etc.) for training the ML model.
Real-time weather API for live weather updates (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
2. Development Tools
Frontend: Android Studio (for UI/UX design using XML and Java/Kotlin).
Backend: Flask/Django for the ML model integration and API services.
3. APIs
Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for accessing forecast data.
Payment gateway API (e.g., Razorpay/PayPal) for checkout.
4. Core Features
Weather Analysis: Predict rainfall using an ML model with Python.
Recommendation Engine: Suggest products based on predicted rainfall.
User Interface: Interactive single-page app for product suggestions.
Integration: Smooth connection between frontend and backend.
5. Libraries & Frameworks
Frontend: Material Design components, Glide/Picasso for images.
Backend: Flask, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
Weather Analysis: Python ML libraries (e.g., TensorFlow/Scikit-learn).
Database: Firebase or SQLite for storing product data.
6. Hosting/Deployment
Backend/API: Deployed on Heroku/AWS/GCP.
Android App: Available on Google Play Store.
